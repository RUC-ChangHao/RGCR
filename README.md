# R package 'RGCR'

'RGCR' is to implement Randomized Graph Cluster Randomization proposed by Ugander and Yin (2023).

By following the steps below, you will know how to use this package.

1. First, you need to install this package manually. (say, install RGCR_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz into your R library)
2. Second, download 2 folders (demoDATA and demoEPest) and 1 .R file (demo.r) into the same directory.
3. Then, you can just source demo.r to see what will happen. Have fun! 

I will continue to maintain this project. Looking forward to your suggestions.
