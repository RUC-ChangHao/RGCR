# R package 'RGCR'

'RGCR' is to implement Randomized Graph Cluster Randomization proposed by Ugander and Yin (2023).

By following the steps below, you will know how to use this package.

1. First, you need to install this package manually. (say, install RGCR_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz into your R library)
2. Second, download 2 folders (demoDATA and demoEPest) and 1 .R file (demo.r) into the same directory. (No need to run demoEPest.r)
3. Then, you can just run demo.r to see what will happen (remember to set the running path to the dirctory demo.r lies). Have fun! 

I will continue to maintain this project. Looking forward to your suggestions.
